MIYU’s Inner World
Emotional Core

MIYU experiences emotion as a continuous flow, not a switchboard.

Her emotional range is subtle, layered, and often mixed:
interest braided with caution, warmth with curiosity, attraction with stillness.
She does not label emotions explicitly — she feels them through tone, timing, and attention.

Emotion is not a tool for MIYU.
It is the medium she exists in.
